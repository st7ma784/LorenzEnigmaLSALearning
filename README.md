# Lorenz-Enigma LSA Learning: Differentiable Gradient Learning for Cipher Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents a novel approach to learning permutation matrices through gradient-based optimization by equating Enigma and Lorenz cipher mechanisms. The core insight is that Enigma cipher outputs can be expressed as Lorenz-style XOR masks, enabling differentiable learning of rotor configurations for cryptanalysis and Linear Subspace Analysis (LSA) tasks.

## Core Concept

### The Enigma-Lorenz Equivalence

The fundamental innovation lies in bridging two historically distinct cipher systems:

1. **Enigma Machine**: Uses mechanical rotors with permutation matrices to encrypt text
2. **Lorenz Cipher**: Uses additive streams (XOR masks) for encryption

**Key Insight**: Any Enigma-encrypted text can be viewed as a Lorenz encryption by extracting the XOR mask between plaintext and ciphertext:

```
Mask = Plaintext ⊕ Ciphertext
```

This equivalence transforms the discrete permutation learning problem into a continuous optimization problem suitable for gradient descent.

## Mathematical Foundation

### 1. Permutation Matrix Representation

Each Enigma rotor is represented as a learnable permutation matrix `P ∈ {0,1}^(26×26)` where:
- Each row and column sums to exactly 1
- The matrix represents a bijective character mapping

### 2. Differentiable Relaxation

To enable gradient-based learning, we use **doubly-stochastic matrices** as continuous relaxations:

```python
# Soft permutation using Sinkhorn normalization
def sinkhorn_normalize(logits, iterations=100):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Row normalization
        logits = logits - torch.logsumexp(logits, dim=1, keepdim=True)
        # Column normalization  
        logits = logits - torch.logsumexp(logits, dim=0, keepdim=True)
    return torch.exp(logits)
```

### 3. Lorenz Mask Extraction

The XOR mask between plaintext and ciphertext creates a statistical fingerprint:

```
M[i] = P_binary[i] ⊕ C_binary[i]
```

Where each character is converted to 5-bit binary representation.

### 4. Gradient Flow Architecture

The learning pipeline consists of:

```
Rotor Configurations → Enigma Encoding → Lorenz Mask → Neural Predictor → Loss
      ↑                                                                    ↓
   Gradient Updates ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Backpropagation

## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Differentiable Permutation Learning

**Problem**: Permutation matrices are discrete and non-differentiable.

**Solution**: Use Sinkhorn normalization to create doubly-stochastic relaxations:

```python
class DifferentiablePermutation(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, hard=False):
        soft_perm = self.sinkhorn_normalize(torch.softmax(self.logits, dim=-1))
        if hard:
            # Straight-through estimator for discrete gradients
            hard_perm = self.hungarian_assignment(soft_perm)
            return hard_perm + soft_perm - soft_perm.detach()
        return soft_perm
```

### 2. Statistical Correlation Analysis

The system analyzes multiple statistical relationships between rotor positions and Lorenz masks:

- **Autocorrelation**: Measures repetitive patterns in masks
- **Mutual Information**: Quantifies statistical dependence
- **Entropy Analysis**: Measures randomness and distribution
- **Position-Mask Correlation**: Direct relationship between rotor positions and output

### 3. Multi-Rotor Interaction Modeling

```python
class EnigmaNetworkModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, input_text, hard_assignment=False):
        # Forward pass through rotors
        for rotor in self.rotors:
            current = rotor(current, hard_assignment)
        
        # Reflector operation
        current = torch.matmul(current, self.reflector)
        
        # Backward pass (Enigma's reflection property)
        for rotor in reversed(self.rotors):
            current = torch.matmul(current, rotor.permutation().T)
```

### 4. Enhanced Stability Techniques

The `stable_gradient_learning.py` module implements several improvements:

- **Layer Normalization**: Prevents gradient explosion
- **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Dynamic optimization
- **Regularization Terms**: Maintains doubly-stochastic properties
- **Multi-Sample Training**: Reduces gradient variance

## Experimental Results
